Between the upstream and downstream, it uses a queue to decouple event processing and delivery logic. The correspondence between gateway-related resources and BIG-IP resources is as follows: From the above figure, we can see the correspondence between gateway-related resources and each resource on BIG-IP, that is, when using BIG-IP as a provider, the specific form of each gateway resource on BIG-IP is: K8S Resources BIG-IP Resources GatewayClass BIG-IP Device + Partition Gateway Virtual HTTPRoute iRule Service Pool Deploy(pods) Member","title":"Overview"},{"location":"Architecture/#overview","text":"","title":"Overview"},{"location":"Architecture/#frame-and-flow-design","text":"Basically, bigip-kubernetes-gateway architecture is designed as follows: It uses kubebuilder and controller-runtime framework to connect to the k8s cluster side and receive user operation events on various resources such as Gateway, HTTPRoute, Service, etc. It uses f5-bigip-rest module to connect to BIG-IP via iControl REST to do resource deliveries and deployments.
